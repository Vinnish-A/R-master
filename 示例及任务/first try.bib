	abstract = {Adoptive cell therapy with genetically modified T cells has generated exciting outcomes in hematologic malignancies, but its application to solid tumors has proven challenging. This gap has spurred the investigation of alternative immune cells as therapeutics. Macrophages are potent immune effector cells whose functional plasticity leads to antitumor as well as protumor function in different settings, and this plasticity has led to notable efforts to deplete or repolarize tumor-associated macrophages. Alternatively, macrophages could be adoptively transferred after ex vivo genetic modification. In this review, we highlight the role of macrophages in solid tumors, the progress made with macrophage-focused immunotherapeutic modalities, and the emergence of chimeric antigen receptor macrophage cell therapy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ)-dependent upregulation of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) mediates protumor (also known as M2-like) polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). However, upstream factors determining PPAR-γ upregulation in TAM protumor polarization are not fully identified. S100A4 plays crucial roles in promotion of cancer malignancy and mitochondrial metabolism. The fact that macrophage-derived S100A4 is major source of extracellular S100A4 suggests that macrophages contain a high abundance of intracellular S100A4. However, whether intracellular S100A4 in macrophages also contributes to cancer malignancy by enabling TAMs to acquire M2-like protumor activity remains unknown. METHODS: Growth of tumor cells was evaluated in murine tumor models. TAMs were isolated from the tumor grafts in whole-body S100A4-knockout (KO), macrophage-specific S100A4-KO and transgenic S100A4WT-EGFP mice (expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the S100A4 promoter). In vitro induction of macrophage M2 polarization was conducted by interleukin 4 (IL-4) stimulation. RNA-sequencing, real-time quantitative PCR, flow cytometry, western blotting, immunofluorescence staining and mass spectrometry were used to determine macrophage phenotype. Exogenous and endogenous FAO, FA uptake and measurement of lipid content were used to analyze macrophage metabolism. RESULTS: TAMs contain two subsets based on whether they express S100A4 or not and that S100A4+ subsets display protumor phenotypes. S100A4 can be induced by IL-4, an M2 activator of macrophage polarization. Mechanistically, S100A4 controls the upregulation of PPAR-γ, a transcription factor required for FAO induction during TAM protumor polarization. In S100A4+ TAMs, PPAR-γ mainly upregulates CD36, a FA transporter, to enhance FA absorption as well as FAO. In contrast, S100A4-deficient TAMs exhibited decreased protumor activity because of failure in PPAR-γ upregulation-dependent FAO induction. CONCLUSIONS: We find that macrophagic S100A4 enhances protumor macrophage polarization as a determinant of PPAR-γ-dependent FAO induction. Accordingly, our findings provide an insight into the general mechanisms of TAM polarization toward protumor phenotypes. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that targeting macrophagic S100A4 may be a potential strategy to prevent TAMs from re-differentiation toward a protumor phenotype.},
